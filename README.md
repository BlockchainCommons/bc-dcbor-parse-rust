# dCBOR Diagnostic Parser and Composer

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Wolf McNally_

---

This crate provides tools for parsing and composing the [CBOR diagnostic notation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949#name-diagnostic-notation) into [dCBOR (deterministic CBOR)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/) data items.

It is intended for use in testing, debugging, the `dcbor` command line tool, and other scenarios where a human-readable representation of dCBOR is useful. It is not optimized for performance and should not be used in production environments where binary dCBOR is expected.

The primary functions provided are:

- `parse_dcbor_item`: Parses a string in CBOR diagnostic notation into a `CBOR` object.
- `parse_dcbor_item_partial`: Parses the first item in a string and reports how
  many bytes were consumed.
- `compose_dcbor_array`: Composes a `CBOR` array from a slice of strings representing dCBOR items in diagnostic notation.
- `compose_dcbor_map`: Composes a `CBOR` map from a slice of strings representing the key-value pairs in dCBOR diagnostic notation.

The syntactical types supported are:

| Type                | Example(s)                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boolean             | `true`<br>`false`                                           |
| Null                | `null`                                                      |
| Integers            | `0`<br>`1`<br>`-1`<br>`42`                                  |
| Floats              | `3.14`<br>`-2.5`<br>`Infinity`<br>`-Infinity`<br>`NaN`      |
| Strings             | `"hello"`<br>`"ðŸŒŽ"`                                          |
| ISO-8601 Dates      | `2023-10-01T12:00:00Z`<br>`2023-10-01`                      |
| Hex Byte Strings    | `h'68656c6c6f'`                                             |
| Base64 Byte Strings | `b64'AQIDBAUGBwgJCg=='`                                     |
| Tagged Values       | `1234("hello")`<br>`5678(3.14)`                             |
| Name-Tagged Values  | `tag-name("hello")`<br>`tag-name(3.14)`                     |
| Known Values        | `'1'`<br>`'isA'`                                            |
| Unit Known Value    | `Unit`<br>`''`<br>`'0'`                                     |
| URs                 | `ur:date/cyisdadmlasgtapttl`                                |
| Arrays              | `[1, 2, 3]`<br>`["hello", "world"]`<br>`[1, [2, 3]]`        |
| Maps                | `{1: 2, 3: 4}`<br>`{"key": "value"}`<br>`{1: [2, 3], 4: 5}` |

## Parsing Named Tags and Uniform Resources (URs)

A [Uniform Resource (UR)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) is a URI representation of tagged dCBOR, where the tag is represented as a text type component. The last component of the UR is the untagged CBOR encoded as ByteWords, including a CRC-32 checksum in the last eight letters.

To parse named tags and URs, the correspondence between the tag name (UR type) and the integer CBOR tag value must be known. This is done by using the `with_tags!` macro to access the global tags registry. Clients wishing to parse named tags and URs must register the CBOR tag value and its corresponding name in the global tags registry. The [`dcbor`](https://crates.io/crates/dcbor) crate only registers one tag and name for `date` (tag 1). The [`bc-tags`](https://crates.io/crates/bc-tags) crate registers many more. See the `register_tags` functions in these crates for examples of how to register your own tags.

## Status - Community Review

`dcbor` is now considered production-ready but the parser/composer is new and may require further refinement. We are looking for feedback from the community to help us improve the API and functionality. We are also looking for additional test cases to ensure that the parser/composer works correctly in all scenarios.

Let us know if the API meets your needs, and the functionality is easy to use. Comments can be posted [to the Gordian Developer Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/116).

See [Blockchain Commons' Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md).
